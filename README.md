# Recursion

This exercise was made following [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-recursion) curriculum.\
The idea was to make a function that let you replicate a fibonacci sequence, and for the other side make a merge sort algorythm.

### Tools Used:

Javascript.

### Testing the code

You need to have node installed for it to work. \
Clone the repo and go to the terminal and type **node [file-name]**.
